## About Me

Hi, I’m **Hasan Tareq** — a **Full-Stack Web Application Developer** with over **8 years of professional experience** in building scalable, secure, and high-performance web solutions.

I primarily work with **WordPress, Laravel, and modern JavaScript (React / MERN)**. My strength lies in **clean architecture, OOP-driven PHP development, API integrations, and product-focused engineering**. I care deeply about **code quality, maintainability, security, and performance**.

I’ve worked on both **client projects and product-based systems**, led teams, and contributed to widely-used WordPress plugins. My long-term goal is to **build product-driven software and establish my own tech company**.
